# 🚂 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: Python Not Found

### Problem
Railway is not finding Python, even with explicit configuration.

### Solutions Applied

#### 1. Nixpacks Configuration (`nixpacks.toml`)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python311", "python311Packages.pip"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["pip install -r requirements.txt"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["echo 'Build phase complete'"]

[start]
cmd = "python3 app.py"
```

#### 2. Docker Configuration (`Dockerfile`)
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
ENV PORT=5000
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

#### 3. Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
- Uses `Dockerfile` for consistent Python environment
- Guaranteed Python 3.11 installation
- More reliable than Nixpacks

### Option 2: Nixpacks
- Uses `nixpacks.toml` configuration
- Railway's native build system
- May have Python detection issues

### Option 3: Manual Configuration
- Set build command in Railway dashboard
- Use environment variables
- Override default settings

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Use Docker Builder
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Build
4. Change builder to "Dockerfile"
5. Redeploy

### 2. Alternative: Manual Build Command
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Deploy
4. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set start command: `python3 app.py`
6. Redeploy

### 3. Environment Variables
Add these in Railway dashboard:
- `PYTHONPATH`: `/app`
- `PORT`: `5000`

## File Structure for Railway

```
├── app.py                 # Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile            # Docker configuration
├── nixpacks.toml         # Nixpacks configuration
├── railway.json          # Railway configuration
├── Procfile              # Process file

```

## Testing Locally

### Test Docker Build
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t eduwaves-invoice .

# Run locally
docker run -p 5000:5000 eduwaves-invoice
```

### Test Python App
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run app
python3 app.py
```

## Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- ✅ App starts without Python errors
- ✅ Homepage loads at Railway URL
- ✅ Book search works
- ✅ School search works
- ✅ PDF generation works
- ✅ All features functional

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Try different build methods (Docker vs Nixpacks)
3. Verify all files are in repository
4. Check Railway documentation for updates
